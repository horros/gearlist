    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

    <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
        These Terms of Use are an agreement regarding what you can and cannot do with Gearlist, and
        what we at Gearlist can and cannot do with your data.
    </p>

    <h3>What we are</h3>

    <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
        The service consists of a way to upload gear data (make, model, etc) and attaching images to them.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
        We agree to offer Gearlist as a service free of charge, for anyone over the age of 16. The age limit has nothing to
        do with the content on the page, it is more an inability for Gearlist to handle GDPR parental consent forms. Sorry kids!
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
        This means that by <strong>signing up you confirm that you are age 16 or older</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>What can you do?</h3>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
        You can use Gearlist if you are <strong>16 or older</strong> and <strong>have not had your account terminated by us for any reason</strong>.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
        Reasons to terminate your account are:
        <ul style="margin-left: 1em;">
            <li>
                Deliberately trying to overload the service by
                <ol type="I">
                    <li>Storing an excess amount of bogus data (e.g. things that aren't actually instruments, music gear, or other actual physical items)</li>
                    <li>Storing an excess amount of images with the data (the number of images is not set in stone, but please don't save 100 images for one guitar - be sensible)</li>
                    <li>Hotlinking to images. This means uploading images to the Gearlist service and linking directly to those images from e.g. forum posts</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Doing anything that is deemed as unlawful, unethical, misleading, fradulent or unauthorized</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>What we promise</h3>
    
    <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
        Gearlist will not use your email address for anything untoward, and we don't collect any other information. For more information, see the <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <p style="padding-left: 2em; margin-top: 2em; font-size: larger;">
        <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Be over 16 and don't be a jerk. We'll never sell your email and we'll try our best to keep the service running.
