        <h2>Privacy policy</h2>

        <p>
            TL;DR: We at Gearlist <span style="color: red;">💖</span> privacy. We will never sell your information to any third party. We will never
            collect any data about you beyond the bare minimum to be able to technically operate the service.<br />
            Email us and we'll show you exactly what data we have stored on you.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3>What data do we collect?</h3>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
            When logging in using a local account, Gearlist stores a technical id (subject) and email address.
            Your email address is used when you log in.<br />
            <strong>IF</strong> you log in using a federated identity provider (that means an external ID, so eg.
            Google, Facebook etc) your name will be automatically received and stored in Azure AD B2C. Work is in progress to remove that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>How do we collect your data?</h3>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
            You directly provide the data we collect. We collect data when you:

            <ul>
                <li>Sign up or sign in to the service, either using local accounts or external identity providers</li>
                <li>Save data into the system</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3>How do we use your data?</h3>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
            Your data is only used for logging you in and linking data you actively save into the system to your account.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
            You will receive an email if you opt-in to receiving notifications when people find your stolen gear (when that feature becomes available).
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3>How and where do we store your data?</h3>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
            Gearlist does not maintain any infrastructure itself. Your user account related data is stored in Microsoft's
            Azure AD B2C. The data you save is stored in an Azure Cosmos DB database. The API uses Azure Functions. Images
            you upload are stored in an Azure Blob storage. All of the Microsoft-operated services are located within the
            West Europe region, except for Cosmos DB whose read/write region is Switzerland North. Switzerland has received
            an "adequacy decision" from the European Commission which means Switzerland's privacy laws are compatible with
            GDPR.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
            All communication from your browser onwards and between all services is encrypted using TLS encryption.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Marketing</h3>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
            We will never sell your email address or any of your data to anyone. We will never send you any marketing related
            email. We will never contact you unless with opted-in features (see "How do we use your data") or as required by law
            in case of a data breach.
        </p>
